Purpose of this project and the website:

The purpose of this project was to pick a topic that we were interested in, do research about the specific topic, and to pick a tool to learn and research more about. When putting these two things together, we would create a website that others would eventually get to see and possibly even learn from.

This website is intended for viewers to learn more about why our thyroid is such an important gland in our body. By viewing the website, you can learn that there are also thyroid diseases and that people who are diagnosed with these diseases should take the necessary medication to get treated for their own well being.
